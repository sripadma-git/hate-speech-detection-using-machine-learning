# 🛡️ Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning 🧠
<br> 
📌 Project Overview
<br> 
This project aims to detect hate speech in text data using machine learning techniques. 🚨 By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and classification models, the system can differentiate between hateful and non-hateful content, contributing to a safer online environment. 🌐
<br> 
<br>
⚙️ Features
<br> 
📝 Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data (removing special characters, stop words, etc.).
<br> 
📊 Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
<br> 
🏋️ Model Training: Training various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and more.
<br> 
📈 Performance Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
<br> 
📬 Prediction: Classifying new text inputs as hate speech or not.
